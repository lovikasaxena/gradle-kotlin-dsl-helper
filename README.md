# About
* Here's a Spring Boot project using gradle with kotlin DSL syntax. 
* Gradle files written in Kotlin aren't that common and I personally have struggled finding good sources on the internet for writing the smallest gradle snippets. The intent is to help others write build.gradle.kts file with my experience building the same. 

# Gradle features used
* Adding dependencies 
* Using existing Plugins like Kotlin, Spring
* Creating custom Tasks 
* Creating custom Plugins 
* Creating a fat jar [PENDING]

# Pre-requisites
